Special Features
Number Highlighting

    When you select a cell, all cells in the same row, column, and box are highlighted in light blue
    All cells with the same value are highlighted in a different color
    This helps you quickly see related cells and avoid errors

Error Tracking

    The game keeps track of how many incorrect numbers you've entered
    Incorrect numbers are displayed in red

Responsive Design

    The game adapts to different screen sizes and works well on both desktop and mobile devices

    generator.js: Contains functions for generating puzzles
    board.js: Manages the game board data
    timer.js: Handles the game timer
    ui.js: Manages UI interactions and updates
    app.js: Main application initialization

Future Improvements
